Software Engineering

Emphasis on product, process, quality

SDLC: implementation only 10-20% of time spent (Waterfall model)
	1. Planning
	2. Analysis
	3. Design
	4. Implementation
	5. Testing & Integration
	6. Maintenance

1. Planning
-Scope, resource, cost, time, benefits

2. Analysis
-Requirement, management plan, specification document

3. Design
- Architectural/ Detailed Design.

4. Implementation
-Coding

5. Testing and Deployment
- Unit testing etc

6. Maintenance
- Corrective, Adaptive, Preventive, Perfective

Easy to follow, provide structure, set targets, only used for mature products


Sprial model
-4 phases that are done in iterations, which could be long
-Emphasis on risk analysis, combining planning and documentation with prototyping


Good Software key points
1. Maintainability
2. Dependabiility and security
3. Efficciency
4. Acceptability


UML Diagrams
- Shows the interactions between users and systems (E.g. Cashier system has cashier and customers interacting with it)

•Actor
	- Refers to a particular role of a user of the system
	- Similar to external entities; they exist outside of the system
•Boundary
	- which defines the system of interest in relation to the world around it.
	- Use cases in the boundary, i.e the box
	- Actors outside the boundary
•Use case symbols
	- An oval indicating the task of the use case
•Connecting lines (relationships)
	- Arrows and lines are used in diagram for behavioral relationships
	- Depicts a usage relationship (Actor using a function)s

DFD
Process: any process that changes the data, producing an output
Data Store: files or repositories that hold information for later use, such as a database table or a membership form.
Data Flow: the route that data takes between the external entities, processes and data stores

•The data flow diagram must have only ONE process
•Must not have any freestanding objects
•A process must have both an input and output data flow.
•A data store must be connected to at least one process.
•External entities should not be connected to one another.


ER Diagram
Entity -> Rectange (i.e. the variable)
Attribute -> Oval
Key -> Underline (if it is the PKEY)
Relationship -> Diamond (Used to connect 2 or more entities)


CIA
-Confidentiality: Information is only disclosed to those with the rights to know
-Integrity: Information is correct and not manipulated in any way
-Availability: Information is accessible and usable at all time.


Attacks
•Social Engineering
	–Phishing,  Spear Phishing, Vishing, Smishing,  Mining Social Media, Man-In-The-Middle Attack,  Man-In-The-Browser Attack
•Malware
	–Virus, Worm, Trojan Horse, Spyware
		-Virus: infects a host computer and spreads embed itself within another program or file
		-Worm: Autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers
		-Trojan: Program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program with harmful effects
		-Spyware: Collects information about activities on computer and reports back to instigator of attack
		-Adware: A form of malware that hides on your device and serves you advertisements
		-Ransomware: Encrypts a victim’s files and demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon payment
•Denial Of Service (DOS)
	- Overload Computer until unable to process request
•Botnets
•Spam


Protection
•Firewall
•Proxy Server
•Network Auditing Software
•Anti-Virus
•Secured Connection – SSL
•Authentication
•Cryptography
