Prove one is a subset of other
A ∩ B = B - (B - A)

A - B = {1,2,3} when A={1,2,3,4,5} and B={4,5,6,7,8}

|P(A)| =  cardinality of the power which is 2^(number of elements in set)


Function f: A -> B
assignment of each element of A to exactly one element of B
A is domain of f
B is codomain of f
i.e. f(a) = b, b is image of a under f and a is preimage of b

Range of f is set of all images under f, i.e. f(A)

function: each input is related to exactly one output
functions are same if they have same domain, same codomain and map

empty set is always a subset of all set

P(set) is power set, which is a set of all possible subsets, where is size is 2^(size of set)

|set|, the absolute is the size of the set.

one to one (injective) each element in b has at most one connection
onto (surjective) each element in b has at least one connection
bijection if each element in b has exactly one connection

tuple -> ordered collection
set -> unordered collection
ordered pair -> 2 tuples

Cartesian product -> A x B = {(a,b)| a∈A ^ b∈B}

Binary relation -> A subset of the cartesian product

Relations

Reflexive if every element of A is in the relation with itself
symmetric if it is always ok to swap the order
Antisymmetric, never okay to swap order
Transitive, can always skip a step, i.e. (x,y) and (y,z) -> (x,z)


Sum of all degrees of vertices in a graph is always twice the number of edges in the graph
Total degree of graph = 2(number of edges)

tree is a connected graph that does not contain any circuits
tree with n vertices has n-1 edges
vertices(dots), edges(lines)

leaf (vertex of degree 1)
branch (vertex of degree greater than 1)
