Things to note: 
1. All connected Interfaces and PCs should be in same network in order to ping unless something else is configured
2. All PCs should have their firewall and wifi disabled.
3. ping and tracert are useful for troubleshooting

OSPF
	sh ip ospf neighbor
	sh ip protocols
	sh ip ospf
	sh ip ospf int
	
	1st router:
		router ospf 1
		network {network address} area 0
		router-id 11.11.11.11
		passive int {interface}
		auto-cost reference-bandwidth 100
		
		int g0/0
		bandwidth 128
	
	2nd router:
		router ospf 1
		passive-interface default
		no passive-interface g0/0
		
		

The OSPF router ID is used to uniquely identify the router in the OSPF routing domain. Cisco routers derive
the router ID in one of three ways and with the following precedence: 
1) IP address configured with the OSPF router-id command, if present 
2) Highest IP address of any of the router’s loopback addresses, if present 
3) Highest active IP address on any of the router’s physical interfaces 

The passive-interface command prevents routing updates from being sent through the specified router
interface.

Because the OSPF cost metric must be an
integer, all links with transmission speeds of 100Mb/s or higher have a cost of 1. This results in Fast Ethernet,
Gigabit Ethernet, and 10G Ethernet interfaces all having the same cost. Therefore, the reference-bandwidth
must be changed to a higher value to accommodate networks with links faster that 100Mb/s.
