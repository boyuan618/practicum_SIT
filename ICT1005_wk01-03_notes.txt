p -> q
converse: q -> p
contrapositive: ~q -> ~p
inverse: ~p -> ~q

*** P -> Q === P only if Q
*** Q -> P === P if Q

truth table
rows: 2^number of unique elements

D.N.F = Take all True results from truth table and make all elements true
(e.g. row in truth table is T T F T, then it will be a^b^~c)
***DNF is and(^) between the elements and or(V) between the rows
(e.g. T T F T and T F T T would be (a^b^~c)V(a^~b^c)

C.N.F = Take all False results from truth table and make all elements false
(e.g. row in truth table is F F T F then it will be aVbV~c)
*** CNF is or(V) between elements and and(^) between rows
(e.g. F F T F and F T F F would be (aVbV~c)^(aV~bVc)

***For both DNF and CNF, negation should only be on the element itself
*** From DNF to CNF can use distributive law


Formalising arguements
(e.g. All lectures are boring. P(x): x is lecturer, Q(x) x is boring.
âˆ€x(P(x) -> Q(x)): for all x, if x is lecturer then x is boring)
