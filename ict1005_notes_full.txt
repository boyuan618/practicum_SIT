p -> q
converse: q -> p
contrapositive: ~q -> ~p
inverse: ~p -> ~q

*** P -> Q === P only if Q
*** Q -> P === P if Q

truth table
rows: 2^number of unique elements

D.N.F = Take all True results from truth table and make all elements true
(e.g. row in truth table is T T F T, then it will be a^b^~c)
***DNF is and(^) between the elements and or(V) between the rows
(e.g. T T F T and T F T T would be (a^b^~c)V(a^~b^c)

C.N.F = Take all False results from truth table and make all elements false
(e.g. row in truth table is F F T F then it will be aVbV~c)
*** CNF is or(V) between elements and and(^) between rows
(e.g. F F T F and F T F F would be (aVbV~c)^(aV~bVc)

***For both DNF and CNF, negation should only be on the element itself
*** From DNF to CNF can use distributive law


Formalising arguements
(e.g. All lectures are boring. P(x): x is lecturer, Q(x) x is boring.
∀x(P(x) -> Q(x)): for all x, if x is lecturer then x is boring)

Prove one is a subset of other
A ∩ B = B - (B - A)

A - B = {1,2,3} when A={1,2,3,4,5} and B={4,5,6,7,8}

|P(A)| =  cardinality of the power which is 2^(number of elements in set)


Function f: A -> B
assignment of each element of A to exactly one element of B
A is domain of f
B is codomain of f
i.e. f(a) = b, b is image of a under f and a is preimage of b

Range of f is set of all images under f, i.e. f(A)

function: each input is related to exactly one output
functions are same if they have same domain, same codomain and map

empty set is always a subset of all set

P(set) is power set, which is a set of all possible subsets, where is size is 2^(size of set)

|set|, the absolute is the size of the set.

one to one (injective) each element in b has at most one connection
onto (surjective) each element in b has at least one connection
bijection if each element in b has exactly one connection

tuple -> ordered collection
set -> unordered collection
ordered pair -> 2 tuples

Cartesian product -> A x B = {(a,b)| a∈A ^ b∈B}

Binary relation -> A subset of the cartesian product

Relations

Reflexive if every element of A is in the relation with itself
symmetric if it is always ok to swap the order
Antisymmetric, true is (a,b) and (b,a) are not in relation, and if (a,b) and (b,a) are in the relation, a == b must be true for it to be antisymmetric.
Transitive, can always skip a step, i.e. (x,y) and (y,z) -> (x,z)

equivilance relations are relations in a set that satisfy reflexive, symmetric and transitive
equivilance classes are subsets of numbers that when formed together as a relation satisfies the requirements.

simple graph -> no loops or parallels
Sum of all degrees of vertices in a graph is always twice the number of edges in the graph
Total degree of graph = 2(number of edges)


tree is a connected graph that does not contain any circuits
tree with n vertices has n-1 edges
vertices(dots), edges(lines)

leaf (vertex of degree 1)
branch (vertex of degree greater than 1)

descriptive statistics - data to describe or reach conclusions about that same group only
inferential statistics - sample data from a small group to reach conclusions of the larger population where sample is from

population -> entire population, usually large and expensive
sample -> a small subset of population, usually used to represent the larger population

Mean ->  Sum of all data/ number of data *** if from frequency table remember to multiply the frequency to the value 
Median -> middle data value when the dataset is ordered in ascending order. (No calculations needed)
Mode -> Data with the highest frequency

Interquartile range is 25% to 75% -> sort data, find median then find median of first half and second half

population variance -> o^2 
population standard deviation -> square root(o^2)

sample variance -> s^2
sample standard deviation -> square root(s^2)
**combined standard deviation -> s^2 combined = (1/(n1+n2))(n1[s1^2+(mean1-meancombined)^2] + n2[s2^2+(mean2-meancombined)^2])


Classical probability -> All random outcomes are equally likely
Relative probability -> Probability assigned to an outcome is the proportion of times would occur in the long run
Subjective probability -> assigned based on a person's belief of the likelihood that it will occur

random variable -> a value that follows some probability distribution, subject to some randomness or chance

discrete random variable -> can find probabilities with exact outcome, from countable list
continuous random variable -> limited to finding probabilities for intervals of values, from interval or colellection of intervals

frequency distribution -> represents discrete data variables
probability distribution -> represents disccrete random variables

Law of large numbers -> as the number of trials increase, the mean outcome will tend to become the expected value


Conditions for binomial random variable:
1. Finite number of trials
2. only 2 outcomes
3. Fixed number of trials
4. Probability of sucess or failure is constant

probability density function -> f(x) = p

sample standard dev = pop standard dev/sqrt(sample size)
unbiased point esimate for mean same formula
for unbiased variance must use n-1 formula (x-u) one, not the var(x) one

Two characteristics that are valuable in a point estimator:
	1. The sampling distribution of the point estimator should be centered over the true value of the parameter to be estimated.
	2. The spread (as measured by the variance) of the sampling distribution should be as small as possible.

point estimate-> area in between, the x-zs/root(n) < u< x+zs/root(n) formula

alpha = 1- confidence level

***if size is <30 use t table, if size > 30 use z table
