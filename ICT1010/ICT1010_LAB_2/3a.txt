A->B = yes
A->C=no
B->C=no
they are in a different network
Default vlan is vlan 1
Ports assigned to default vlan Fa0/1-24, G0/1-2.
A->B=yes, as they are in the same vlan

vlan f0/24 is now associated with vlan 1, the default vlan
vlan 30 default name is VLAN0030
traffic to f0/24 just do not go through and are dropped
f0/24 is now assigned to vlan 1, the default vlan
This is as traffic directed to the port not reassigned would continue attempting to go to a vlan that does not exist. Since the vlan does not exist, 
the traffic is dropped and simply stops there.

A->B=yes
A->C=no
B->C=no
As PC C is in a different vlan

Trunking mode is used as dtp is a serious security risk and an attacker can use dtp to form a trunk with out switch


Reflection 
1. A layer 3 device like a layer 3 switch or router
2. Proper segmentation of network for better cybersecurity, reduce IT costs
