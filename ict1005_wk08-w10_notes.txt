descriptive statistics - data to describe or reach conclusions about that same group only
inferential statistics - sample data from a small group to reach conclusions of the larger population where sample is from

population -> entire population, usually large and expensive
sample -> a small subset of population, usually used to represent the larger population

Mean ->  Sum of all data/ number of data *** if from frequency table remember to multiply the frequency to the value 
Median -> middle data value when the dataset is ordered in ascending order. (No calculations needed)
Mode -> Data with the highest frequency

Interquartile range is 25% to 75% -> sort data, find median then find median of first half and second half

population variance -> o^2 
population standard deviation -> square root(o^2)

sample variance -> s^2
sample standard deviation -> square root(s^2)
**combined standard deviation -> s^2 combined = (1/(n1+n2))(n1[s1^2+(mean1-meancombined)^2] + n2[s2^2+(mean2-meancombined)^2])


Classical probability -> All random outcomes are equally likely
Relative probability -> Probability assigned to an outcome is the proportion of times would occur in the long run
Subjective probability -> assigned based on a person's belief of the likelihood that it will occur

random variable -> a value that follows some probability distribution, subject to some randomness or chance

discrete random variable -> can find probabilities with exact outcome, from countable list
continuous random variable -> limited to finding probabilities for intervals of values, from interval or colellection of intervals

frequency distribution -> represents discrete data variables
probability distribution -> represents disccrete random variables

Law of large numbers -> as the number of trials increase, the mean outcome will tend to become the expected value


Conditions for binomial random variable:
1. Finite number of trials
2. only 2 outcomes
3. Fixed number of trials
4. Probability of sucess or failure is constant

probability density function -> f(x) = p
